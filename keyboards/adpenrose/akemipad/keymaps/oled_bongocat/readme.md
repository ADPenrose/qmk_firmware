# The Bongo Cat VIA-compatible keymap for the AkemiPad

# Features
- Audio Click capabilitiy.
- RGB Matrix Lighting (cycles left-right and up-down).
- LEDs turn on and off depending on the layout selected on the UI.
- Encoder Map feature.
- Bongo Cat animation with WPM counter and Caps Lock/Num Lock indicators.

This keymap is optimized for a numpad and can fit the RGB matrix (with 
very few animations due to AVR constraints), the encoder map, the audio 
click feature and the display of the OLED animations. This was possible 
thanks to the [squeez-o](https://github.com/nullbitsco/squeez-o) compression tool.
